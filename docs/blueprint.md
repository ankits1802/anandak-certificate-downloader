# **App Name**: CertiPort

## Core Features:

- Real-Time Search: Implement a search bar with real-time suggestions, enabling users to search by name, district or mobile number. Make this functionality available even without calling a back-end (all in the browser).
- Candidate Display: Display candidate details, scores, comparative graph and a 'Download Certificate' option upon selecting a candidate.
- Certificate Generation: Generate customized certificates dynamically with candidate name (in camel case), district, scores, and remarks, along with dynamic graphs. The remarks can be simple assessments such as 'Passed' or 'Failed' based on score.
- Dynamic Graphs: Display a dynamic graph comparing the selected candidate's scores with district and overall averages/high scores.
- Single Page Design: Implement a single-page application layout for seamless navigation and quick access to information.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A subdued blue (#6699CC) to inspire trust and professionalism in the platform.
- Background color: A light gray (#F0F0F0), allowing the components to stand out and ensuring legibility.
- Accent color: A muted green (#8FBC8F), to signal success and completion, used for positive indicators such as graph elements that outperform averages.
- Body text: 'PT Sans', a versatile humanist sans-serif (also good for headlines if needed).
- Use a consistent style of flat, modern icons to represent districts and performance metrics. 
- Use a card-based layout to present the search results, candidate details, and graphs to enhance readability.
- Add subtle transitions when displaying candidate information or when downloading certificates for a smoother user experience.
